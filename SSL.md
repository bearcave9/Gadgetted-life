SSL
---
* protects the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit between
the userâ€™s browser and the web server.
* It helps defend against eavesdroppers, and it can provide assurance
to the user of the identity of the web server he is dealing with.
* But it does not stop attacks that directly target the server or client components of an application, as most successful attacks do.
Specifically, it does not prevent any of the vulnerabilities just listed, or many
others that can render an application critically exposed to attack. Regardless of
whether they use SSL, most web applications still contain security flaws.
